    <h3>Daniel Caesar com Kali Uchis | Get You</h3>
    <p>Through drought and famine, natural disasters
        My baby has been around for me
        Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
        None of that could ever make me leave
        Every time I look into your eyes I see it
        You're all I need
        Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
        <br>
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        <br>
        And when we're making love
        Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
        It's only the two of us
        Everything I need's between those thighs
        Every time I look into your eyes I see it
        You're all I need
        Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
        <br>
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        <br>
        And I’ll take some time
        Just to be thankful
        That I had days full of you, you
        Before it winds down into
        The memories, it’s all just memories
        <br>
        (If you've got someone you like)
        Don't you love when I come around
        (Feel something that's right, somebody just tell somebody)
        Bill you up then I take you down
        <br>
        (If you've got someone you like)
        Don't you love when I come around
        (Feel something that's right, somebody just tell somebody)
        Build you up then I take
        <br>
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oh, who would've thought I'd get you
        <br>
        This feels like summer
        Boy, you make me feel so alive
        Just be my lover
        Boy, you'll lead me to paradise</p>
